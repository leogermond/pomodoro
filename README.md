# pomodoro
A very simple pomodoro timer, written in sh

# Installation
Simply put a link to pomodoro in your bin, I usually have a *~/bin* in my **$PATH** for that kind of stuff

To enjoy a sound alert, add a WAV file */usr/share/sounds/pomodoro/alert.wav*

# Usage
**\#** pomodoro

At the screen enter your choice between a (P)omodoro session, a (S)hort pause or a (L)ong pause, then you can reduce the window and enjoy it updating in the taskbar.
